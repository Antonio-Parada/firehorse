            <h2>What is Acupuncture? ☯️</h2>
            <p>Acupuncture has its roots and history in the eastern countries of Asia. This scope of health involves stimulating specific points on the body often with very thin sterile needles to promote healing and balance.</p>
            <p>Acupuncture is used for various conditions, including chronic and acute pain, nausea, fatigue, and several other mental and physical disharmonies. Acupuncture mainly works by stimulating the body's natural healing response. When pressure and fine needles are inserted into specific acupoints, its benefit is to release chemicals in the brain, spinal cord, and muscles that can help relieve pain and promote well being.</p>
            <p>If the fear of needles for treatment is present to the patient, the practitioner may use other modalities such as Acupressure, moxibustion (heat therapy), cupping & Guasha (Massage techniques) to achieve healthy benefits.</p>
